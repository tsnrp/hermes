TSN files for hermes

Currently nick's script pulls hermes off of https://github.com/StarryWisdom/hermes-bin/raw/master/hermes
as such the binaries here don't do anything :/
at some point that probably should be fixed but it either involves a flag day 
for all users of hermes+nebula (probably just the hosts of the TSN) or means
the naming of the startup vars for nebula would be odd.

Windows builds are a pain as such there is a moderate chance they are out of
date at any time (I will try to mark them when this is the case), if the size
of the windows builds shrink quickly (currently 1.1MB) that is a sign starry 
has been an idiot and forgotten to link them statically ... again - fix that
via either prodding starry or installing the MSVC runtime.
